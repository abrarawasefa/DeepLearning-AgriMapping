# Using the S2A Downloading Notebook

This markdown document outlines the steps for utilizing the S2A Downloading Notebook to download Sentinel-2A satellite images for your projects. Follow these instructions to get started.

## Setup

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following requirements met:

- Python installed on your machine.
- Access to a terminal or command prompt.
- An internet connection for downloading images and dependencies.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository containing the S2A Downloading Notebook to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Notebook

1. **Open the Notebook**: Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab in your browser:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Or for JupyterLab:
   ```
   jupyter lab
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Notebook**: In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and open the `S2A_downloading.ipynb` notebook.

3. **Execute the Code**: Run each cell in the notebook sequentially. Make sure to read the comments and instructions provided within each cell to understand the actions being performed and any inputs you need to provide.

## Configuration

- **API Keys**: Some steps may require authentication with an API key. Ensure you have obtained the necessary keys or credentials beforehand and input them as instructed in the notebook.

- **Target Area and Time Frame**: Specify the geographical area and time frame for which you wish to download satellite images by modifying the relevant variables in the notebook.

## Post-Downloading

After downloading the images, you might want to perform post-processing steps as outlined in the notebook. These could include image cropping, rescaling, or visualization techniques to prepare the data for your analysis.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with dependencies, ensure all required packages are correctly installed and up-to-date.
- For problems related to API access, verify that your credentials are correct and that you have access to the necessary services.
