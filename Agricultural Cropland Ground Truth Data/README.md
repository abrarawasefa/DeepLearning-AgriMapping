# Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Classification Scheme

This document describes the ground truth data for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification in the study area. The classification includes three primary categories: **Background**, **Irrigated Fields**, and **Field Boundaries**. Each category is crucial for understanding the LULC dynamics in the area.

## Categories Description

### 1. Background

- **Description:** This category encompasses various LULC types that do not fit into the more specific categories of the study. It includes a wide range of land covers such as built-up areas, shrublands, grasslands, bare land, wetlands, and water bodies. The diversity within the background category reflects the complexity of the landscape and the multitude of LULC types present in the area.

### 2. Irrigated Fields

- **Description:** These are agricultural lands that rely on artificial water supply systems to support crop growth. This category is significant in arid and semi-arid regions where natural rainfall is insufficient for agriculture. Irrigation methods range from traditional surface irrigation techniques to more modern methods such as drip and sprinkler systems. This category highlights the adaptation strategies employed to overcome water scarcity and sustain agricultural productivity.

### 3. Field Boundaries

- **Description:** This category focuses on the delineation of agricultural fields within the study area. It involves creating boundary polygons by extracting and buffering the edges of individual fields from shapefiles. The process ensures that each agricultural plot is distinctly identified, aiding in the detailed examination of land use practices and the spatial distribution of agricultural activities within the study area.
